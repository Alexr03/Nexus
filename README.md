# Welcome to the Nexus Bot README!
Thank you for wanting to try out the Nexus bot. Nexus on its own is a baseplate for developers to add modules. Without any modules, a bot just goes online on Discord and does nothing!

## How to create modules
Refer to [Module Example](https://gitlab.openshift.alexr03.dev/nexus/module-example)

## How to install on TCAdmin and use the TCAdmin Module


## Built-in commands
| Command | Function |
|--|--|
| ;author | Shows information on who created the bot |
| ;lyhme | Shows our early adopter! |
| ;modules | Shows modules that are installed |
